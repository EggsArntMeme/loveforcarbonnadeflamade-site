        	<h3 class="ta-c">First: proving other dishes inferior</h3>
			<p>With other dishes, including other soup or stew dishes, the wide spread knowledge about them brings about their popularity, constantly being seen in the public eye may delude people into believing that their favourite dish is superior, when it in fact, may lead to the opposite. With more people knowing about your dish, it brings people to become lazy with the assembly and or creation of it. For example, think about a burger, almost everyone knows about burgers in the western hemisphere. If you were to make one yourself, wouldn't you take the time to create the perfect burger? No, solely the most appealing to you, and with ingredients within your household, which people will spread their personal, and frankly lazy, recipes to others. Carbonnade Flamande, with it being the hidden jem that it is, only has recipes like my own that are dedicated to the absolute perfection of the dish. Love and compassion are crucial to cooking a new recipe, and you must feel it from the author as well. This page sole existance is to spread the love for carbonnade flamande.</p>

					<h3>Acquiring the ingredients</h3>
					<p>While other recipes may require one to collect ingredients like “the most fresh bay leafs from the far reaches of the jungle”. However, as carbonnade flamande, it is a simplistic dish where the complexity comes out with the chef's dedication and love for carbonnade flamande, NOT with fancy ingredients. The only possibly hard to acquire ingredient is belgium beer, however almost every liquor store contains different drinks from every country. Once you’ve acquired everything for the dish, it’s best to lay them all out to get a better feel for the perfection you’re about to create. Just absolute, perfection.</p>

					<h3>Why love soup?</h3>
					<p>As humans evolved, we’ve learned that we gain more power from cooked food versus raw, later on learning that it's due to the nutrients and other factors that helped form a stronger body and mind. One of the most simplistic way to cook anything is through boiling, we then found flavour within the bones of the animal, and the beer we create. We had created an easy to make, yet nutritious dish to better ourselves. Soup, along side the other inventions used to create carbonnade flamande like beer and fire, are all attributed to being turning points to humanity’s progression in life. My love for soup, as well as love for carbonnade flamande, stands tall due to its existence helping push us forward in this world.</p>

			<h3>Who am I to be making these claims?</h3>
			<p>My occupation and experiences may not immediately lead one to believe that I would dedicate my life to this dish, however if you take the time to hear my story you will understand why I have developed my love for this dish. At a young age, soups had always soothed my soul, and brought a sort of inner peace within myself. During my middle years of life, I hadn’t the time to dedicate myself to meals, as my job took many hours of my life and left very few for my own personal pleasure. It was excruciating. Now, I am working a better job which, on a business trip, I had first had the delight of tasting Carbonnade Flamande. After the first taste I decided to dedicate my life </p>
